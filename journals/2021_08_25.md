- TODO [[Python]] [[pyenv]] The workflow for managing python environments:
  1. Installing latest python version in pyenv:
  ```bash
  # First check list of pyenv versions available and your versions
  pyenv install --list
  
  pyenv versions
  
  # Choose version and install
  pyenv install -v 3.9.6
  
  # If versions not found, try updating pyenv with 
  brew update && brew upgrade pyenv
  ```
- TODO [[git]] If you want your local branch to exactly match the remote branch, this can be done in 2 steps:
  todo:: 1629909025605
  ```bash
  git fetch origin
  git reset --hard origin/BRANCH_NAME
  ```
  If you want to save your current branch's state before doing this (just in case), do the following:
  ```bash
  git commit -a -m "Saving my work, just in case"
  git branch my-saved-work
  ```
