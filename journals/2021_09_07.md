	- **Bubble Sort**
		- Goal:
			- The goal is to sort a list of numbers from least to greatest.
		- Conceptualize:
			-
			  1. Start with the first pair of numbers and compare them.
			-
			  2. Whichever is larger we move to the rightmost position.
			-
			  3. Then move to the next two pair of numbers in the list & perform Steps 1 & 2.
			-
			  4. Iteratively do this until you reach of the end list. The largest number shall now be in the last position within the list.
			-
			  5. Return to Step 1 and restart the process. Continually perform these steps until all numbers are sorted in the list.
		- Complexity:
			- Worst: (Where N is the length of the input array)
				- Time - O(N^2)
				- Space - O(1)
			- Best:
				- Time - O(N)
				- Space - O(1)
			-
		- Python Implementation:
			-
			  ```py
			  def bubbleSort(array):
			  	isSorted = False
			      counter = 0
			      while not isSorted:
			      	isSorted = True
			          for i in range(len(array) - 1 - counter):
			          	if array[i] > array[i + 1]:
			              	swap(i, i + 1, array)
			                  isSorted = False
			          counter += 1
			      return array
			      
			  def swap(i, j, array):
			  	array[i], array[j] = array[j], array[i]
			  ```
